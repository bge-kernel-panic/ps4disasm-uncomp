- Level 99 fix.

- Fixed level 99 bug exclusive to Seth.

- The Tornado Dagger name now displays correctly in battle (TORNDAGGER instead of ORNDAGGER).

- When characters level up, their stats are not updated until you check their equipment or their status screen, or when you use the Order command.
  This patch has had this behavior corrected.
  
- Vision now uses the Mental stat of the caster rather than a fixed value.

- Lowered stat deficits of the Shadow Blade so that Chaz's stats underflow will no longer happen before level 5.

- Now Chaz is revived after the battle against Zio to prevent a Game Over if Chaz, Rika and Rune are dead.

- Fixed incorrect logic for palette cycling in the Air Castle.

- Fixed Wren usage number for Posibolt at level 91.

- Stats are now updated for Chaz when you get the Elsydeon.

- When you go into the menu immediately after opening the chests containing the Canceller in Zelan and the rings in the Rykros towers,
  the event flags needed to trigger subsequent cutscenes won't be set. This has been addressed so it no longer happens.

- Chaz will no longer say "This is terrible!" when examining the houses in Ryuon.

- Fixed collision detection for Reshel, Island Cave and Elsydeon cave.

- When you select an option while holding a directional button, the cursor will skip to the next option. For example, if you're on
  ITEM and want to select TECH right below, you will accidentally select SKILL instead of TECH. This is particularly annoying when you do
  fast inputs. This has been addressed in this patch.

- In Aiedo, the blue-haired NPC who likes Alys will no longer cause a softlock when he runs away and collides with walls and trees.

- Fixed graphics and RAM corruption bug that happens when you press Cancel at a specific frame after making a selection on the
  Message speed, Battle speed, Buttons, Macro Skill list and Macro confirm windows.
  
- Fixed graphics glitch when you press Cancel in the Aiedo bakery shop list.

- Fixed map layout for the Island Cave.

- The Psy-Robe now grants protection against psychic attacks like the other Psy gear.

- When you use Ryuka before finishing the first mission in Piata, you're automatically teleported to Piata. This event causes
  dialogue boxes to be empty when talking to NPCs. This will no longer happen.
  
- When a character has a shield that protects against an element, that element is also applied to the equipped weapon. This patch ensures only
  the equipped weapon elements are taken into account when you attack.

- Some armors and gears provide resistance against physical attacks so you take as much damage as when you use the Defend command. However
  such equipment and Defend share the same value in RAM, with Defend taking precedence over the armor resistance, so any kind of protection granted
  by said gear will be lost. This patch ensures that defensive gear with physical resistance will take precedence instead.

- When you a press a button the same frame you enter a battle, the input gets saved in a variable which doesn't get reset, meaning that any
  kind of interaction (e.g. open menu) will still take place automatically after the battle. This has been fixed.

- The Igglanova was given status immunities like the other bosses.

- Fixed up message that shows up when the whole party dies by poison on the field.

- Raja can no longer equip the Psycho Wand so you won't end up losing it when he leaves the party.

- Items and techniques that cure poison, paralysis and death have the effect of restoring agility and dexterity to their original values, but
  the game doesn't check if the characters are afflicted by those statuses. For example, if you use a Repair Kit on Wren, he will lose all the buffs
  even if he's alive. This patch ensures that the buffs are not lost if characters are not affected by a status effect.

- Fixed Telepipe and Escapipe being thrown away upon use in battle.

- The dungeon flag is not set all the time for the first screen of Zelan and Kuran. This causes Hinas/Escapipe not to work and you're also able to save.
  After fixing the flag logic, these problems should be gone.

- Normally characters can gain more than one level if they earn a lot of EXP in one battle. However characters outside the party are limited to gaining only one level
  per battle regardless of their EXP. This has been changed so everyone can gain multiple levels per battle.
