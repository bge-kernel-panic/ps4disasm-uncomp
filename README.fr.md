This branch is the French translation script. Translation
provided by Benoit Goudreault-Emond and Anthony Gallet.

Please give credit if you use this as a base for your own
work, and do not claim the translation is done by somebody
else.

Do not distribute the result of assembling the decompilation.
It should only be used by those who have a license to the
original game to generate the translation patch file, or for
educational purposes.

Flashing a ROM patched with the translation and selling the
resulting cartridge is strictly prohibited, except for the
original copyright owner. Please respect the authors' wishes
with respect to this.

If you want to play this translation, you should obtain a
legitimate license to the ROM file. SEGA sells it on Steam
so you have no excuse not to do so :)
