The French translators, Benoit Goudreault-Emond and Anthony Gallet, 
would like to extend thanks to the following people:

- Michał Ziąbkowski (mziab@o2.pl) for his very precious help as the
  Polish translator.  He provided several hints on font encoding
  which let me easily add accents, and some warnings about which
  parts of the dialog might crash due to memory limitations. Also
  a great person all around, checking his old notes from years ago
  just to help a random Internet stranger.  Many thanks, Michał!

- Lorenzo (lory2004@gmail.com) for disassembling the PS4 code in
  the first place.  I don't think I would've dared undertaking this
  effort had the symbolic disassembly not been available.  I do know
  M68K assembly, but having to place breakpoints, look at trace logs,
  and whatnot is a bit too time-consuming for parents of school-age
  children.  He also told me the font was 8x16 which did point me
  in the right direction.

- Benoit's daughter, Stéphanie, for bugging him incessantly about 
  the project, but also for beta testing parts of it.

If the translators have forgotten anybody, you may contact Benoit and
request to be added to this file at bgoudreaultemond@gmail.com

French Translation task list:

- Fix width of "cannot flee" message window - DONE
- Add credits screens for translation - DONE
- Fix intro scroll length so people can read the last line - DONE
- Fix the "PRESS START BUTTON" text at title screen DONE
- Munge the font for the credits so we can an apostrophe and
  can properly translate that for "Merci d'avoir joué" (thank you
  for playing)
- Make some modifications optional: DONE
  - Raja's friend Quebec accent, not everybody knows how to decode
    that kind of French :)
  - Changes to credits
  - Font changes other than raw accents or missing letters

French Translation WONTDO:

- With changed credits, music will end before end of credits. I'm
  keeping this as-is because it'd be silly to restart it for a couple
  of frames. What I'll do instead is make the extra frames optional.
